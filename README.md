# ParkIt ![js-standard-style](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Java-brightgreen)
In Ahmedabad city, road side parking was resulting in a lot of traffic and because of that a new rule was implemented by the police department that road side parking is not permitted and if found, will be fined. This gave me an idea of developing a mobile application that will help users in finding a parking lot where they can book a parking spot for a duration of time and pay for it in the app. This application was connected with a Node MCU 8266 and ultra sonic sensor to detect if a car is parked at a parking spot and this can help users see how many parking spots are left in a parking lot.
